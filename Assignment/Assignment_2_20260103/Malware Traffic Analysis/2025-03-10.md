#### 4️⃣ Malware Behavior Observed

###### Describe:

* DNS resolution of malicious domain
* HTTP GET request for payload
* Execution of downloaded file
* C2 beaconing every X seconds
* Possible data exfiltration

<hr/>

#### 5️⃣ Command and Control Activity

###### Explain:

#### 6️⃣ MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

###### Example mapping:

| Tactic	        | Technique |
|-----------        |-----------|
|Initial Access	    | Phishing (T1566)|
|Execution	        | User Execution (T1204)| 
|Command & Control	|Application Layer Protocol (T1071) |
|Exfiltration	    | Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) |

<hr/>

#### 7️⃣ Risk Assessment

###### Example:

```
The malware establishes persistent outbound C2 communication, 
allowing remote attacker control and potential data exfiltration. 
Immediate containment is required.
```

<hr/>

#### 8️⃣ Recommendations

* Isolate infected host
* Block malicious IP/domain
* Reset credentials
* Perform full endpoint scan
* Deploy EDR monitoring
